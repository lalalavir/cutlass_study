Welcome to this CUTLASS study blog.

This is not a link dump. It is a practice-first learning log:  
I aim to make each post reproducible, comparable, and easy to extend.

## Why I write this series
- Turn my CUTLASS learning path into structured notes
- Avoid fragmented learning that fades after a few days
- Build a solid base for CuTe, fused operators, and newer architectures

## Who this is for
- Readers with basic CUDA/C++ experience
- People who want to start CUTLASS without getting blocked by too much abstraction
- Learners who want a knowledge base they can revisit anytime

## Scope of this site
- Focus on CUTLASS fundamentals and engineering intuition
- Bind each post to clear code paths whenever possible
- Start from minimal runnable examples, then expand step by step

## Suggested reading flow
1. Start with the first post listed under `CUTLASS Basics`
2. Run each referenced example at least once
3. Revisit source details and parameter changes afterward

## Update policy
- This is a continuously evolving set of notes
- Corrections and clearer explanations are updated directly in place
